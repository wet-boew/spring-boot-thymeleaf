# WET Centrally Distributed Template Solution (CDTS) for Spring Boot and Thymeleaf

This is a Spring Boot Starter that uses Thymeleaf to implement CDTS.

## Benefits of using this version of CDTS.

Since this version is based on Spring Boot, simply adding the dependency to your POM file is enough to do most of the configuration.  The only config requried after that is to add the `WETTemplateInterceptor` to your list of interceptors.

After that, there is no need to extend any beans!  Just write normal Spring MVC controllers and make sure your Thymeleaf templates reference one of the provided layouts (currently default and transactional layouts for internet use.  Intranet templates haven't been added, yet).

This makes getting started with CDTS very easy, and your code will not rely on anything from the CDTS library specifically.

Also, since the templates are based on Thymeleaf, they are plain HTML5 by default and require no tags.  This makes them much easier to read.

## Building wet-cdts-spring-boot-thymeleaf-starter

* Clone the repository
* From the repository root, using java 8, run `maven install`

## How to use wet-cdts-spring-boot-thymeleaf-starter

1) Add the starter to your projects POM file.
```
    <dependency>
      <groupId>ca.canada.ised.wet.cdts</groupId>
      <artifactId>wet-cdts-spring-boot-thymeleaf-starter</artifactId>
      <version>4.0.32.0</version>
    </dependency>
```

2) Add the WETTemplateInterceptor to your applications list of interceptors.
```
    /**
     * Web configuration.
     */
    @Configuration
    public class WebConfig extends WebMvcConfigurerAdapter {
    
        /** The cdn template interceptor. */
        @Autowired
        private WETTemplateInterceptor cdnTemplateInterceptor;
        
        /** {@inheritDoc} */
        @Override
        public void addInterceptors(InterceptorRegistry registry) {
            super.addInterceptors(registry);
            registry.addInterceptor(cdnTemplateInterceptor);
        }
    }
```

3) Use one of the supplied templates as the basis for your Thymeleaf templates.
```
    <html xmlns:layout="http://www.ultraq.net.nz/thymeleaf/layout" layout:decorator="layouts/layout">
      <head>
        <title>Page Title</title>
	   </head>
	   <body>		
        <div layout:fragment="content">
          <div>This content will be included in the "content" div of the template.</div>
          <div>Language: <span data-th-text="#{lang}">lang</span></div>
          <div>This screen, home.html, uses <b>layout:decorator="layouts/layout"</b></div>
          <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-4">
              <div class="form-group">
                <form action="#" data-th-action="@{#{url.sideMenu}}" method="post">					        
                  <button class="btn btn-primary" name="sideMenuButton" type="submit">See Side Menu Page</button>      
                </form>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>      
      </body>
    </html>
```

## Manually Releasing
Currently the build infa does not allow direct contact to github, so releases will have to be done manually.
For tagging in eclipse, see https://wiki.eclipse.org/EGit/User_Guide#Tagging
1. Update the pom file manually to a released version, committing with message "creating a release of 4.0.32.X" 
2. Ensure that the the project is built correctly
3. In eclipse, open the history view of the pom file
4. Click "Create Tag" on the commit
5. Enter tag name of "wet-cdts-spring-boot-thymeleaf-starter-4.0.32.X" with message "Releasing 4.0.32.X"
6. Push to upstream
